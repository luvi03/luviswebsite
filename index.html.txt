<h2> Letter To Self</h2>
<p>Dear Self,
although this whole coding thing is new, I can see that you are slowly enjoying it. In a way it reminds us of a puzzle of some sort. I know that you love learning new things, and now that you are presented with something you never came across before, you are hooked. See this as an opportunity to gain knowledge that not many people don't have access too. You have a greater chance at getting chosen for a job opportunity or just even networking opportunity. Especially now that we are heading towards a digital world, this can come in handy. Keep up the good work!
Later, Luvi. <p>
